summary: Cual es el rédito?

Una nota interesante[0] sobre cual es negocio de las páginas de Facebook.

   It’s called Like Farming. Here’s how it works. Someone creates a page and starts posting photos inspirational quotes or other innocent content. You like the page and it now shows up regularly in your news feed. Anytime you interact with a post, that activity shows up in your friends’ news feeds.The more likes the page gets, the more it shows up. The more comments each picture gets, the more power the page gets in the Facebook news feed algorithm.And that makes it more and more visible.


Al final es todo sobre la publicidad y los adds.

I'll keep you posted.
